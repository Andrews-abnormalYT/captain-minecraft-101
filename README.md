   Captain Minecraft 101 Website <br /> <br />
  <body>
    Welcome to Captain Minecraft 101's official website! Here you can find some infomation about how my channel started. <br />
  <br />
      On July 5, 2022, my friend Tyler asked me how to create a youtube channel. He was a friend from my school and he knows that I am a tech genius. So I **Showed** 
      him how to create a YouTube channel and we started Co-op on it. 2 Months later, Sep 8, 2022, Tyler asked me to create a channel for his brother Charlie. I did it 
      but it ended up being his channel and the Captain Minecraft 101 channel was left under my hands. I now upload when I have a chance because I'm lazy and don't 
      have enough time to make one anymore. <br /><br />
    I hoped you enjoyed the history of my YouTube Channel, even though it was a bit Boring! Let me tell you something else <br />
      My family <br />
      I have a brother called James, you would have heard him in a lot of my videos! <br />
      I have a nice Auntie called Auntie fify (not her real name) and she checks my videos for bad stuff like face reveals. <br />
      My name is Andrew and I am the founder of this website. I am also a tech genius at my age! <br />
